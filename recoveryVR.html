      As an example of what recovery will look like, your appetite will be drastically reduced and you will only be able to drink 
      liquids and eat soft foods for 2-3 months. Thus, it is important to be careful with your dietary decisions during the start
      of recovery.However, we understand that it can be hard to adhere to strict dietary restrictions and hope to help you set 
      expectations of what may happen in various scenarios. This way, you can anticipate what symptoms are normal and which require
      medical attention before symptoms worsen. With that, we welcome you to <u>Recovery Virtual Reality- Gastric Bypass Simulation</u>. <br>
      For our MVP, we are only showing a text adventure game with various options to choose from, leading to different endings.
      Give it a shot and see how you do!
